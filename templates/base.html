    <h2>Seriously, what the f**k are you looking for this is not the motherf**king website thats a different one!</h2>

    <p>You probably think there's some secret formula to making money online. Guess what there is!</p>

        <li>Work your ass off every f**king day of week and the f**king weekend if its f**king needed</li>
        <li>Look for some great get-rich-quick schemes, atleast sell the schemes to stupid f**king people like you and make some f**king money, but shit you are not even a f**king thief.</li>
        <li>Accept that it's not f**king easy, only spending money is f**king easy</li>
        <li>And even if there was a magic formaula nobody is gonna f**king tell you.</li>
    </ul>
